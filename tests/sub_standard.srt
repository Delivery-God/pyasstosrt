1
00:00:10,58 --> 00:00:13,04
It's time for the main event!

2
00:00:13,04 --> 00:00:18,25
Animal Mask vs. Macadamian Ogre, AKA, MAO!

3
00:00:18,25 --> 00:00:20,12
The masked wrestler, Animal Mask,

4
00:00:20,12 --> 00:00:24,00
will face off against former Judo fighter MAO!

5
00:00:24,00 --> 00:00:26,95
Will this bring an end to their long rivalry?

6
00:00:26,95 --> 00:00:30,04
What kind of match do they
have in store for us tonight?

7
00:00:33,08 --> 00:00:35,58
It's finally time...

8
00:00:36,83 --> 00:00:40,50
Being a pro wrestler was
the first chapter in my life.

9
00:00:40,50 --> 00:00:44,58
And if I can win tonight's
world championship title match,

10
00:00:44,58 --> 00:00:47,29
the second chapter in my life will begin...

11
00:00:49,04 --> 00:00:51,25
It's almost time for the fight!

12
00:00:51,25 --> 00:00:53,37
The world championship title bout!

13
00:00:53,37 --> 00:00:56,70
Big Saigo, I'm monologuing.
Don't interrupt me.

14
00:00:56,70 --> 00:00:58,50
Oh, I see!

15
00:00:58,50 --> 00:01:00,45
So, what will you do if you win tonight?

16
00:01:00,45 --> 00:01:02,62
There's mountains left for you to climb!

17
00:01:02,62 --> 00:01:04,91
Yes, that's exactly right.

18
00:01:04,91 --> 00:01:09,29
When I win tonight's match,
the second chapter in my life will begin.

19
00:01:09,29 --> 00:01:11,08
Oh, what is it?

20
00:01:11,08 --> 00:01:12,79
You're quitting pro wrestling to do MMA?

21
00:01:12,79 --> 00:01:15,41
No, maybe Muay Thai or Capoeira?

22
00:01:15,41 --> 00:01:18,33
Very well. I'll tell you... I'm going to...

23
00:01:18,33 --> 00:01:20,20
Whoops, looks like we're out of time.

24
00:01:20,20 --> 00:01:22,00
Break a leg and all that.

25
00:01:22,00 --> 00:01:26,45
Go out there and smash up
that Macadamian Ogre guy.

26
00:01:26,45 --> 00:01:27,87
Big Saigo.

27
00:01:27,87 --> 00:01:30,04
He's always in a hurry.

28
00:01:30,54 --> 00:01:36,54
"No Pets!!"
The second chapter in my life that will begin
when I win tonight's title match...

29
00:01:36,54 --> 00:01:40,29
Is when I will live my life
surrounded by the animals I love,

30
00:01:40,29 --> 00:01:43,20
and share the joy of living with animals
with people everywhere!

31
00:01:45,66 --> 00:01:48,66
"Interdimensional Title Match
Animal Mask vs MAO"
Let's go, Hiroyuki.

32
00:01:51,29 --> 00:01:56,20
The Macadamian Ogre!

33
00:01:56,20 --> 00:01:59,33
And now, entering the ring...

34
00:01:59,33 --> 00:02:01,58
The man who loves animals a little too much!

35
00:02:01,58 --> 00:02:09,12
Weighing in at 198 pounds, it's Animal Mask!

36
00:02:12,29 --> 00:02:13,95
It's finally time...

37
00:02:13,95 --> 00:02:18,62
My rival, MAO.
A worthy opponent for my last match!

38
00:02:18,62 --> 00:02:23,87
The second chapter of my life will begin
after I slam you into the mat...

39
00:02:25,16 --> 00:02:26,54
...and that is!

40
00:02:27,95 --> 00:02:30,91
Opening a pet shop!

41
00:02:46,41 --> 00:02:49,54
Strongest warrior from another world...

42
00:02:49,54 --> 00:02:52,33
You're as strong as ever, Mao!

43
00:02:52,33 --> 00:02:53,54
Impressive!

44
00:02:53,54 --> 00:02:54,66
However!

45
00:02:55,37 --> 00:02:58,83
I pray you answer my call!

46
00:02:58,83 --> 00:03:03,37
Animal Mask has climbed up onto the ropes!

47
00:03:03,37 --> 00:03:05,83
And now he's jumped!

48
00:03:05,83 --> 00:03:07,58
So has Hiroyuki!

49
00:03:07,58 --> 00:03:10,25
Wait! They've started to glow!

50
00:03:10,25 --> 00:03:12,41
What is this?

51
00:03:12,41 --> 00:03:14,29
They disappeared!

52
00:03:14,29 --> 00:03:16,29
What is this?

53
00:03:16,29 --> 00:03:20,75
Animal Mask has disappeared!

54
00:03:20,75 --> 00:03:23,20
Huh? What?

55
00:03:38,87 --> 00:03:40,87
Are you the hero?

56
00:03:42,08 --> 00:03:43,58
I am Animal Mask!

57
00:03:43,58 --> 00:03:45,54
Did the hero-summoning ritual fail?

58
00:03:45,54 --> 00:03:46,75
Why is he in his underwear?

59
00:03:46,75 --> 00:03:49,04
Is he a pervert?

60
00:03:49,04 --> 00:03:52,41
I don't care who you are!

61
00:03:52,41 --> 00:03:57,87
If you've answered our call,
then you are our hero!

62
00:03:57,87 --> 00:03:59,58
What's going on?

63
00:03:59,58 --> 00:04:02,04
Another trick of Big Saigo's?

64
00:04:02,04 --> 00:04:05,95
No... this isn't the arena.

65
00:04:05,95 --> 00:04:08,54
So where am I?

66
00:04:08,54 --> 00:04:14,25
Please, Hero, will you defeat
the evil demon beasts that stalk this land

67
00:04:14,25 --> 00:04:17,83
as well as the Demon King?

68
00:04:17,83 --> 00:04:19,70
Evil demon beasts?

69
00:04:19,70 --> 00:04:23,45
Yes, terrifying animals called monsters...

70
00:04:23,45 --> 00:04:26,00
Exterminate every one of them
from this land...

71
00:04:26,95 --> 00:04:28,45
Hero?

72
00:04:28,45 --> 00:04:32,12
It appears I heard you right after all.

73
00:04:33,62 --> 00:04:37,58
You're telling me to defeat animals for you?

74
00:04:37,58 --> 00:04:41,66
Yes. They're terrifying and disgusting beasts...

75
00:04:42,58 --> 00:04:44,54
Um, Hero?

76
00:04:44,54 --> 00:04:47,70
We can do that after you
defeat the Demon King...

77
00:04:47,70 --> 00:04:51,58
Or at least when nobody's watching...

78
00:04:51,58 --> 00:04:55,91
Hero... Um, Hero?

79
00:04:59,54 --> 00:05:01,87
Hero?!

80
00:05:12,45 --> 00:05:15,50
Winner!

81
00:06:46,75 --> 00:06:49,91
"Wrestler x Summoning"

82
00:06:50,91 --> 00:06:53,37
The princess's noble butt
is being shown to the world!

83
00:06:53,37 --> 00:06:55,91
Somebody, hide her butt!

84
00:06:55,91 --> 00:06:57,95
Defeat animals?

85
00:06:57,95 --> 00:07:00,00
So the blood of an animal lover
that flows through my veins

86
00:07:00,00 --> 00:07:03,75
forced me to give that impudent
girl a German suplex?

87
00:07:03,75 --> 00:07:05,25
You bastard...

88
00:07:05,25 --> 00:07:09,83
Hero, I understand that you're angry
about being summoned like this,

89
00:07:09,83 --> 00:07:12,83
but you can't do that to the princess.

90
00:07:12,83 --> 00:07:17,16
I don't know what you're talking about
with this summoning and hero nonsense!

91
00:07:17,79 --> 00:07:21,33
But... perhaps I went too far.

92
00:07:21,33 --> 00:07:22,83
I know!

93
00:07:26,33 --> 00:07:27,75
Drape.

94
00:07:34,50 --> 00:07:36,79
Stop messing around!

95
00:07:36,79 --> 00:07:39,41
Capture him!

96
00:07:39,41 --> 00:07:40,25
Damn!

97
00:07:40,25 --> 00:07:42,12
I was trying to be a gentleman
and help the lady out,

98
00:07:42,12 --> 00:07:43,20
why are they mad?

99
00:07:43,20 --> 00:07:46,70
What kind of lunatic waves
a sword at someone like that?

100
00:07:55,25 --> 00:07:57,12
This definitely isn't the arena.

101
00:07:57,12 --> 00:07:59,29
It's not even night anymore.

102
00:07:59,29 --> 00:08:02,08
Where am I?

103
00:08:02,08 --> 00:08:03,08
Who is that?

104
00:08:03,08 --> 00:08:04,16
Where are his pants?

105
00:08:04,16 --> 00:08:05,66
Is he a pervert?

106
00:08:05,66 --> 00:08:07,91
We should stay away...

107
00:08:07,91 --> 00:08:08,79
He looked over here.

108
00:08:08,79 --> 00:08:10,20
Don't meet his gaze.

109
00:08:10,20 --> 00:08:13,33
Somebody go call a hunter!

110
00:08:13,33 --> 00:08:16,75
I guess I'll just find someone
kind-looking to ask.

111
00:08:16,75 --> 00:08:19,79
Um, excuse me... Can you tell me where I am?

112
00:08:22,75 --> 00:08:24,12
I get it!

113
00:08:24,12 --> 00:08:28,66
It's rude to ask people questions
while wearing a mask!

114
00:08:34,91 --> 00:08:38,62
The moment I take off my mask,
I'm no longer Animal Mask--

115
00:08:38,62 --> 00:08:41,37
I'm an ordinary man named Genzo Shibata.

116
00:08:41,37 --> 00:08:42,25
Now no one will know...

117
00:08:42,25 --> 00:08:44,20
Over there! That's him!

118
00:08:44,20 --> 00:08:44,58
--Watch out! It's a pervert!

119
00:08:44,58 --> 00:08:47,08
--What?
--Watch out! It's a pervert!

120
00:08:47,08 --> 00:08:48,50
Impossible!

121
00:08:49,16 --> 00:08:50,50
The pervert ran away!

122
00:08:50,50 --> 00:08:51,75
After the pervert!

123
00:08:51,75 --> 00:08:54,45
I'm not a pervert! I'm a pro wrestler!

124
00:08:58,62 --> 00:09:02,04
I have no idea how they figured me out.

125
00:09:02,04 --> 00:09:04,58
But don't worry, Hiroyuki.

126
00:09:04,58 --> 00:09:07,75
I'll figure out a way out of this.

127
00:09:10,41 --> 00:09:12,12
Sorry, Hiroyuki.

128
00:09:12,12 --> 00:09:14,70
Forgive me for being useless...

129
00:09:16,66 --> 00:09:20,45
Hiroyuki! I'm so glad you're here with me!

130
00:09:20,45 --> 00:09:23,29
I don't know what I would've done
if I were here by myself.

131
00:09:23,29 --> 00:09:25,08
I don't care about clothes! Not at all!

132
00:09:25,08 --> 00:09:28,00
My goal is to find food for you tonight!

133
00:09:29,08 --> 00:09:32,50
Bro, that pervert looks pretty buff.

134
00:09:32,50 --> 00:09:34,66
We could sell him for a lot.

135
00:09:34,66 --> 00:09:41,54
Yes. And that strange creature
would probably be worth a lot of cash.

136
00:09:49,95 --> 00:09:52,00
You're so cute...

137
00:09:52,00 --> 00:09:55,04
You there, in your underwear.

138
00:09:55,04 --> 00:09:56,95
Wh-What?

139
00:09:56,95 --> 00:10:00,00
Animal ears?!

140
00:10:05,95 --> 00:10:07,33
A-And...

141
00:10:07,33 --> 00:10:09,37
You're hungry, right?

142
00:10:09,37 --> 00:10:11,45
Come with us and we'll give you some food.

143
00:10:11,45 --> 00:10:13,45
An animal!

144
00:10:13,45 --> 00:10:17,58
Do you like my hairy chest and tail?

145
00:10:19,91 --> 00:10:21,70
You've got nowhere to go, right?

146
00:10:21,70 --> 00:10:24,41
Do what he says...

147
00:10:30,58 --> 00:10:33,58
Bro, this guy seems like bad news...

148
00:10:33,58 --> 00:10:35,25
Y-Yeah...

149
00:10:35,25 --> 00:10:38,20
So fluffy!

150
00:10:38,20 --> 00:10:41,33
He's staring at you, not me!

151
00:10:43,33 --> 00:10:45,37
W-We'll be on our way...

152
00:10:46,66 --> 00:10:48,45
What the hell?

153
00:10:48,45 --> 00:10:49,62
Do you want to fight?

154
00:10:49,62 --> 00:10:52,58
You think you can beat a beastman
with your bare hands?

155
00:10:52,58 --> 00:10:54,58
Get 'em, bro!

156
00:10:54,58 --> 00:10:58,00
I see... you're a beastman, huh?

157
00:10:59,70 --> 00:11:01,29
Bro!

158
00:11:08,45 --> 00:11:12,12
Hey, you jerk! Get off my brother!

159
00:11:12,12 --> 00:11:14,41
Stop sniffing him!

160
00:11:15,45 --> 00:11:17,37
Misha, this guy is crazy!

161
00:11:17,37 --> 00:11:18,79
He's crazy!

162
00:11:18,79 --> 00:11:23,37
We're sorry, so stop! Let him go!

163
00:11:23,37 --> 00:11:26,50
If you don't, my bro will... my bro will...

164
00:11:26,50 --> 00:11:28,12
What's this guy's deal?

165
00:11:28,12 --> 00:11:30,54
He's incredibly strong!

166
00:11:30,54 --> 00:11:34,54
Don't worry!
You'll start to like it any second!

167
00:11:34,54 --> 00:11:37,16
Oh, you like it when I rub you here, huh?

168
00:11:37,16 --> 00:11:39,66
Stop it!

169
00:11:39,66 --> 00:11:43,41
We'll pay you! Stop it! Please!

170
00:11:43,41 --> 00:11:47,12
See? Feels good, right? Good boy...

171
00:11:50,16 --> 00:11:52,37
Now, you're next...

172
00:11:54,08 --> 00:11:56,79
Cat ears!

173
00:11:59,62 --> 00:12:02,79
Shigure, give up already!

174
00:12:04,70 --> 00:12:07,41
You're about to be sold!

175
00:12:07,41 --> 00:12:10,29
No!

176
00:12:10,29 --> 00:12:14,79
I don't want to live at some noble's house
and get walks and naps and free snacks!

177
00:12:14,79 --> 00:12:17,12
Who said you were being sold to a noble?

178
00:12:17,12 --> 00:12:20,12
If that was the deal I'd go myself.

179
00:12:20,12 --> 00:12:23,70
But if they're willing to feed me
filet mignon every day,

180
00:12:23,70 --> 00:12:25,29
I may be willing to let them sell me.

181
00:12:25,29 --> 00:12:29,25
Nobody will buy a beast girl like that!

182
00:12:29,25 --> 00:12:30,54
Let's go!

183
00:12:30,54 --> 00:12:30,91
--No!

184
00:12:30,91 --> 00:12:32,75
--A poor girl in unfortunate circumstances...
--No!

185
00:12:32,75 --> 00:12:34,16
Stop whining and let's go!

186
00:12:34,16 --> 00:12:37,75
It's not right for an outsider
like me to get involved.

187
00:12:37,75 --> 00:12:42,37
And not because I'd rather pet the cat ears...

188
00:12:42,37 --> 00:12:44,79
That tail! Those ears! Is that a wolf?

189
00:12:44,79 --> 00:12:48,45
I've had plenty of experience touching
cats and dogs, but never a wolf!

190
00:12:48,45 --> 00:12:50,95
A girl with cat ears is a hard thing to pass up,

191
00:12:50,95 --> 00:12:54,29
but my priority now is the wolf ears girl!

192
00:12:54,29 --> 00:12:57,00
Please...

193
00:12:57,00 --> 00:12:59,95
All praise animal ears and animal tails!

194
00:12:59,95 --> 00:13:01,29
That's far enough!

195
00:13:01,29 --> 00:13:04,20
Mind your own business.

196
00:13:04,20 --> 00:13:05,70
I don't know who you think you are,

197
00:13:05,70 --> 00:13:07,70
but try anything and you'll regret it.

198
00:13:07,70 --> 00:13:09,04
Really, who are you?

199
00:13:09,04 --> 00:13:11,00
Edgar, he's dangerous!

200
00:13:11,00 --> 00:13:13,54
He's a super-high-level pervert!

201
00:13:13,54 --> 00:13:15,95
He just had his way with my bro...

202
00:13:15,95 --> 00:13:17,20
What?

203
00:13:17,20 --> 00:13:19,95
What are you doing?

204
00:13:19,95 --> 00:13:22,20
Allow me to first correct
your misunderstanding.

205
00:13:22,20 --> 00:13:23,95
I am not a pervert.

206
00:13:23,95 --> 00:13:27,16
I simply love all animals
regardless of gender!

207
00:13:27,16 --> 00:13:30,25
See? He's more dangerous than he looks!

208
00:13:30,25 --> 00:13:33,12
Yeah. The way he dresses,
the things he says...

209
00:13:33,12 --> 00:13:35,91
He's a pervert like none
the world has ever seen!

210
00:13:35,91 --> 00:13:37,79
Why do you fear?

211
00:13:37,79 --> 00:13:43,00
I don't know who you are,
or what reasons you may have...

212
00:13:43,00 --> 00:13:44,70
No! Stop it!

213
00:13:44,70 --> 00:13:49,00
If the wolf girl is upset, you are evil!

214
00:13:53,79 --> 00:13:56,79
Damn it!

215
00:13:56,79 --> 00:13:59,75
You pervert! We'll get you yet!

216
00:14:00,95 --> 00:14:04,91
Come to think of it, I hadn't gotten
to pet the cat ears yet, had I?

217
00:14:04,91 --> 00:14:07,45
Why did you have to open your mouth?!

218
00:14:07,45 --> 00:14:10,00
You're right! I'm sorry!

219
00:14:10,00 --> 00:14:11,33
Um...

220
00:14:14,54 --> 00:14:17,58
Thank you for saving me!

221
00:14:17,58 --> 00:14:20,08
Now I won't be sold.

222
00:14:20,08 --> 00:14:22,54
Don't worry. I did it because I wanted to.

223
00:14:22,54 --> 00:14:25,25
You were about to be kidnapped
by a slaver, right?

224
00:14:25,25 --> 00:14:30,16
No, I'd borrowed money from him, so...

225
00:14:31,70 --> 00:14:32,66
I see.

226
00:14:32,66 --> 00:14:36,04
You were charged absurd amounts of interest
and then sold to pay your debts.

227
00:14:36,04 --> 00:14:39,37
No, I'm the one who said
that if I couldn't pay by the deadline

228
00:14:39,37 --> 00:14:41,33
he could sell me instead.

229
00:14:43,08 --> 00:14:46,33
In exchange, I told him to give me a loan
with no interest and no collateral,

230
00:14:46,33 --> 00:14:51,00
and then cried and sobbed
in front of his shop until he gave in.

231
00:14:51,00 --> 00:14:53,83
I intended to use that money
to start a business and get rich,

232
00:14:53,83 --> 00:14:56,45
but it didn't work out.

233
00:14:56,45 --> 00:14:59,12
She's a loser.

234
00:15:00,00 --> 00:15:01,58
What's that look?

235
00:15:01,58 --> 00:15:03,70
I was making money for a while!

236
00:15:03,70 --> 00:15:08,20
But then humans started copying me.

237
00:15:10,41 --> 00:15:12,25
I am Genzo Shibata.

238
00:15:12,25 --> 00:15:13,70
A pro wrestler.

239
00:15:13,70 --> 00:15:16,08
My name is Shigure.

240
00:15:16,08 --> 00:15:21,45
And this is Hiroyuki. My partner
and a mongrel of pure breeding.

241
00:15:22,75 --> 00:15:25,79
Nice to meet you, too!

242
00:15:25,79 --> 00:15:30,29
Um, I'd love to thank you
for saving me, but...

243
00:15:30,29 --> 00:15:32,29
I'm broke.

244
00:15:32,29 --> 00:15:36,16
But from what you said, it sounds
less like I've done a good deed

245
00:15:36,16 --> 00:15:38,75
and more like I've committed a felony...

246
00:15:38,75 --> 00:15:40,16
Don't worry!

247
00:15:40,16 --> 00:15:43,58
Remember what I said about
people stealing my business model?

248
00:15:43,58 --> 00:15:47,00
The guy who stole it was Edgar,
the guy you just saw!

249
00:15:47,00 --> 00:15:50,70
See? That makes him evil, right? Right? Right?

250
00:15:50,70 --> 00:15:56,75
Well, I guess I could count that
as a good deed, just barely.

251
00:15:56,75 --> 00:15:58,50
So...

252
00:15:58,50 --> 00:16:00,91
You said you were broke, right?

253
00:16:04,04 --> 00:16:06,29
You can pay with your body instead.

254
00:16:06,29 --> 00:16:08,45
He's a loser.

255
00:16:19,04 --> 00:16:20,91
I'll get him...

256
00:16:22,33 --> 00:16:24,45
It's a shame, huh?

257
00:16:25,58 --> 00:16:26,79
You okay?

258
00:16:26,79 --> 00:16:29,25
Damn that bastard.

259
00:16:29,25 --> 00:16:31,41
I won't just give up...

260
00:16:31,41 --> 00:16:33,87
I don't think there's anything you can do.

261
00:16:33,87 --> 00:16:36,04
Got a plan?

262
00:16:36,04 --> 00:16:40,33
Yeah. That strange creature he had.

263
00:16:40,33 --> 00:16:42,08
Oh, that?

264
00:16:42,08 --> 00:16:43,04
What will you do with it?

265
00:16:43,04 --> 00:16:45,66
What else? I'll steal it!

266
00:16:45,66 --> 00:16:48,08
Great idea! Let's do it!

267
00:16:48,08 --> 00:16:50,12
We're gonna do it!

268
00:16:50,12 --> 00:16:50,95
Yeah!

269
00:16:50,95 --> 00:16:52,83
--We'll show that pervert who's boss!

270
00:16:52,83 --> 00:16:55,29
--I have nothing but a bad feeling...
--We'll show that pervert who's boss!

271
00:16:57,50 --> 00:16:58,54
So this is it?

272
00:16:58,54 --> 00:17:00,50
Yes. The Hunter Guild.

273
00:17:00,50 --> 00:17:03,95
Let's work here for a while
to make some money.

274
00:17:03,95 --> 00:17:06,29
You seem to be really strong,

275
00:17:06,29 --> 00:17:11,16
so there's probably lots of great jobs for you.

276
00:17:11,16 --> 00:17:12,12
So you see,

277
00:17:12,12 --> 00:17:16,00
I have complete confidence
in my ability to love any animal

278
00:17:16,00 --> 00:17:20,16
regardless of gender, species,
or even more specifically

279
00:17:20,16 --> 00:17:25,29
hairiness, long-hair, short-hair,
eye color, or tail length!

280
00:17:28,12 --> 00:17:31,20
So I'd like to maintain a relationship of love

281
00:17:31,20 --> 00:17:35,08
and caring with animals at all times!

282
00:17:37,08 --> 00:17:40,70
What? What is he talking about?

283
00:17:40,70 --> 00:17:42,25
And...

284
00:17:42,25 --> 00:17:49,08
Even the fiercest, most violent animal will
respond to my overwhelming love for them.

285
00:17:49,08 --> 00:17:50,04
So...

286
00:17:50,04 --> 00:17:51,12
What do I?

287
00:17:51,12 --> 00:17:53,87
What am I supposed to do here?

288
00:17:55,37 --> 00:17:56,91
Trouble, Guild Master!

289
00:17:56,91 --> 00:17:58,25
What's going on?

290
00:17:58,25 --> 00:17:59,83
I'm saved!

291
00:17:59,83 --> 00:18:02,70
Our party was wiped out by a cerberus pack.

292
00:18:02,70 --> 00:18:04,91
What? Perfect.

293
00:18:04,91 --> 00:18:06,50
Will you go too?

294
00:18:06,50 --> 00:18:08,50
Cerberuses are terrifying monsters...

295
00:18:08,50 --> 00:18:09,33
What?

296
00:18:09,33 --> 00:18:10,16
Where are they?

297
00:18:10,16 --> 00:18:13,08
Genzo! Wait!

298
00:18:13,08 --> 00:18:14,37
What?

299
00:18:14,37 --> 00:18:19,12
What sort of man isn't scared of a cerberus
and instead runs out to meet them?

300
00:18:19,12 --> 00:18:22,00
What a brave man.

301
00:18:22,00 --> 00:18:26,33
But... I didn't understand
a word he was saying.

302
00:18:27,75 --> 00:18:29,08
It's deep in this forest!

303
00:18:29,08 --> 00:18:30,16
Okay!

304
00:18:30,16 --> 00:18:31,58
I don't think I've seen you before.

305
00:18:31,58 --> 00:18:33,00
Are you going unarmed?

306
00:18:33,00 --> 00:18:34,62
You can borrow this if you want.

307
00:18:34,62 --> 00:18:36,04
Fool!

308
00:18:36,04 --> 00:18:39,70
Do I look like a wrestler
who uses weapons to you?

309
00:18:40,95 --> 00:18:42,62
He's going to fight them unarmed?

310
00:18:42,62 --> 00:18:45,16
How confident is he?

311
00:18:45,16 --> 00:18:48,08
Um, I'll borrow it...

312
00:18:48,08 --> 00:18:51,87
Listen, we can't let them get near the town!

313
00:18:51,87 --> 00:18:53,70
Stop them here!

314
00:18:58,95 --> 00:19:00,58
This is bad!

315
00:19:00,58 --> 00:19:02,16
So these are cerberuses?

316
00:19:02,16 --> 00:19:04,79
They've got three heads!

317
00:19:07,33 --> 00:19:10,37
That means triple the fun!

318
00:19:10,37 --> 00:19:12,41
So there are animals like this in this world?

319
00:19:12,41 --> 00:19:14,87
Okay, maybe they look a little strange, but...

320
00:19:16,16 --> 00:19:17,54
Are you scared?

321
00:19:17,54 --> 00:19:19,45
Well, calm down.

322
00:19:19,45 --> 00:19:20,79
Hey!

323
00:19:20,79 --> 00:19:24,66
No, let's see how he handles this.

324
00:19:24,66 --> 00:19:26,70
Yes...

325
00:19:27,37 --> 00:19:30,62
Cerberus!

326
00:19:32,37 --> 00:19:33,95
They appear to be a type of dog.

327
00:19:33,95 --> 00:19:36,87
Which means that if I can become
friends with the pack leader,

328
00:19:36,87 --> 00:19:39,91
the others will quickly open up to me as well.

329
00:19:39,91 --> 00:19:44,16
The leader is probably...
the one guarding the rear!

330
00:19:44,16 --> 00:19:45,37
You?

331
00:19:45,37 --> 00:19:47,45
Hello!

332
00:19:47,45 --> 00:19:48,37
He ran in!

333
00:19:48,37 --> 00:19:50,87
Gotcha!

334
00:19:50,87 --> 00:19:52,50
He dodged them!

335
00:19:54,79 --> 00:19:58,08
Good boy! Let's play!

336
00:20:01,08 --> 00:20:02,95
And now for the leader!

337
00:20:05,83 --> 00:20:07,79
Come here!

338
00:20:14,45 --> 00:20:15,95
He pinned it!

339
00:20:15,95 --> 00:20:17,41
What kind of move is that?

340
00:20:19,04 --> 00:20:20,41
But there are others...

341
00:20:20,41 --> 00:20:21,33
This is bad!

342
00:20:21,33 --> 00:20:22,58
Should we help?

343
00:20:22,58 --> 00:20:24,83
Stay out of this!

344
00:20:25,58 --> 00:20:28,16
He's keeping us out of danger?

345
00:20:28,16 --> 00:20:30,25
What a man!

346
00:20:31,12 --> 00:20:34,50
I think I'm starting to figure him out...

347
00:20:34,50 --> 00:20:37,54
Good boy! Good boy!

348
00:20:37,54 --> 00:20:40,58
You like it here, huh?

349
00:20:47,58 --> 00:20:50,66
Good boy... You're such a good boy...

350
00:20:50,66 --> 00:20:54,16
He really pinned it with his bare hands...

351
00:20:54,16 --> 00:20:56,16
Like you'd pin down a lady...

352
00:20:56,16 --> 00:20:57,83
He's like a lady killer...

353
00:20:57,83 --> 00:21:00,12
No, he's...

354
00:21:00,12 --> 00:21:02,00
...a demon beast killer!

355
00:21:09,58 --> 00:21:11,66
We got enough money from the job
to get you some clothes,

356
00:21:11,66 --> 00:21:13,95
as well as pay for an inn for a while.

357
00:21:13,95 --> 00:21:15,41
Yeah.

358
00:21:15,41 --> 00:21:18,25
So, what will you do now?

359
00:21:18,25 --> 00:21:20,75
I've made my decision.

360
00:21:20,75 --> 00:21:24,04
I want people to understand
how wonderful demon beasts are!

361
00:21:24,04 --> 00:21:26,79
Indeed! I'll bring about a world
where demon beasts and humans

362
00:21:26,79 --> 00:21:28,25
can understand each other!

363
00:21:28,25 --> 00:21:30,91
That's impossible in this country.

364
00:21:30,91 --> 00:21:31,83
No...

365
00:21:33,45 --> 00:21:35,95
I believe I can do it.

366
00:21:35,95 --> 00:21:38,12
So you must believe too.

367
00:21:40,25 --> 00:21:44,87
Genzo, is the reason
you refused to be a hero...?

368
00:21:44,87 --> 00:21:49,87
That princess demanded I defeat animals!

369
00:21:49,87 --> 00:21:53,33
Animals and human,
beast people and humans...

370
00:21:53,33 --> 00:21:56,62
I like it! Let me help, too!

371
00:21:56,62 --> 00:21:59,25
Really? Then let's do this!

372
00:21:59,25 --> 00:22:05,12
Let's do the best with the three of us, no,
the four of us including Hiroyuki!

373
00:22:06,08 --> 00:22:07,75
Yes!

374
00:22:07,75 --> 00:22:08,91
Four?

375
00:22:13,16 --> 00:22:14,37
Who are you?

376
00:23:45,91 --> 00:23:49,91
Next time: "Quest x Demon Beast Killer."
