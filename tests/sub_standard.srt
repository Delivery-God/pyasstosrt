1
0:00:10,58 --> 0:00:13,04
It's time for the main event!

2
0:00:13,04 --> 0:00:18,25
MAO!

3
0:00:20,12 --> 0:00:24,00
will face off against former Judo fighter MAO!

4
0:00:24,00 --> 0:00:26,95
Will this bring an end to their long rivalry?

5
0:00:26,95 --> 0:00:30,04
What kind of match do they
have in store for us tonight?

6
0:00:33,08 --> 0:00:35,58
It's finally time...

7
0:00:36,83 --> 0:00:40,50
Being a pro wrestler was
the first chapter in my life.

8
0:00:44,58 --> 0:00:47,29
the second chapter in my life will begin...

9
0:00:49,04 --> 0:00:51,25
It's almost time for the fight!

10
0:00:51,25 --> 0:00:53,37
The world championship title bout!

11
0:00:53,37 --> 0:00:56,70
I'm monologuing.
Don't interrupt me.

12
0:00:56,70 --> 0:00:58,50
I see!

13
0:00:58,50 --> 0:01:00,45
what will you do if you win tonight?

14
0:01:00,45 --> 0:01:02,62
There's mountains left for you to climb!

15
0:01:02,62 --> 0:01:04,91
that's exactly right.

16
0:01:04,91 --> 0:01:09,29

the second chapter in my life will begin.

17
0:01:09,29 --> 0:01:11,08
what is it?

18
0:01:11,08 --> 0:01:12,79
You're quitting pro wrestling to do MMA?

19
0:01:12,79 --> 0:01:15,41
maybe Muay Thai or Capoeira?

20
0:01:15,41 --> 0:01:18,33
Very well. I'll tell you... I'm going to...

21
0:01:18,33 --> 0:01:20,20
looks like we're out of time.

22
0:01:20,20 --> 0:01:22,00
Break a leg and all that.

23
0:01:22,00 --> 0:01:26,45
Go out there and smash up
that Macadamian Ogre guy.

24
0:01:26,45 --> 0:01:27,87
Big Saigo.

25
0:01:27,87 --> 0:01:30,04
He's always in a hurry.

26
0:01:30,54 --> 0:01:36,54
"No Pets!!"
The second chapter in my life that will begin
when I win tonight's title match...

27
0:01:40,29 --> 0:01:43,20
and share the joy of living with animals
with people everywhere!

28
0:01:45,66 --> 0:01:48,66
Hiroyuki.

29
0:01:51,29 --> 0:01:56,20
The Macadamian Ogre!

30
0:01:56,20 --> 0:01:59,33
entering the ring...

31
0:01:59,33 --> 0:02:01,58
The man who loves animals a little too much!

32
0:02:01,58 --> 0:02:09,12
it's Animal Mask!

33
0:02:12,29 --> 0:02:13,95
It's finally time...

34
0:02:13,95 --> 0:02:18,62
MAO.
A worthy opponent for my last match!

35
0:02:18,62 --> 0:02:23,87
The second chapter of my life will begin
after I slam you into the mat...

36
0:02:25,16 --> 0:02:26,54
...and that is!

37
0:02:27,95 --> 0:02:30,91
Opening a pet shop!

38
0:02:46,41 --> 0:02:49,54
Strongest warrior from another world...

39
0:02:49,54 --> 0:02:52,33
Mao!

40
0:02:52,33 --> 0:02:53,54
Impressive!

41
0:02:53,54 --> 0:02:54,66
However!

42
0:02:55,37 --> 0:02:58,83
I pray you answer my call!

43
0:02:58,83 --> 0:03:03,37
Animal Mask has climbed up onto the ropes!

44
0:03:03,37 --> 0:03:05,83
And now he's jumped!

45
0:03:05,83 --> 0:03:07,58
So has Hiroyuki!

46
0:03:07,58 --> 0:03:10,25
Wait! They've started to glow!

47
0:03:10,25 --> 0:03:12,41
What is this?

48
0:03:12,41 --> 0:03:14,29
They disappeared!

49
0:03:14,29 --> 0:03:16,29
What is this?

50
0:03:16,29 --> 0:03:20,75
Animal Mask has disappeared!

51
0:03:20,75 --> 0:03:23,20
Huh? What?

52
0:03:38,87 --> 0:03:40,87
Are you the hero?

53
0:03:42,08 --> 0:03:43,58
I am Animal Mask!

54
0:03:43,58 --> 0:03:45,54
Did the hero-summoning ritual fail?

55
0:03:45,54 --> 0:03:46,75
Why is he in his underwear?

56
0:03:46,75 --> 0:03:49,04
Is he a pervert?

57
0:03:49,04 --> 0:03:52,41
I don't care who you are!

58
0:03:52,41 --> 0:03:57,87

then you are our hero!

59
0:03:57,87 --> 0:03:59,58
What's going on?

60
0:03:59,58 --> 0:04:02,04
Another trick of Big Saigo's?

61
0:04:02,04 --> 0:04:05,95
No... this isn't the arena.

62
0:04:05,95 --> 0:04:08,54
So where am I?

63
0:04:08,54 --> 0:04:14,25
will you defeat
the evil demon beasts that stalk this land

64
0:04:14,25 --> 0:04:17,83
as well as the Demon King?

65
0:04:17,83 --> 0:04:19,70
Evil demon beasts?

66
0:04:19,70 --> 0:04:23,45
terrifying animals called monsters...

67
0:04:23,45 --> 0:04:26,00
Exterminate every one of them
from this land...

68
0:04:26,95 --> 0:04:28,45
Hero?

69
0:04:28,45 --> 0:04:32,12
It appears I heard you right after all.

70
0:04:33,62 --> 0:04:37,58
You're telling me to defeat animals for you?

71
0:04:37,58 --> 0:04:41,66
Yes. They're terrifying and disgusting beasts...

72
0:04:42,58 --> 0:04:44,54
Hero?

73
0:04:44,54 --> 0:04:47,70
We can do that after you
defeat the Demon King...

74
0:04:47,70 --> 0:04:51,58
Or at least when nobody's watching...

75
0:04:51,58 --> 0:04:55,91
Hero?

76
0:04:59,54 --> 0:05:01,87
Hero?!

77
0:05:12,45 --> 0:05:15,50
Winner!

78
0:06:46,75 --> 0:06:49,91
"Wrestler x Summoning"

79
0:06:50,91 --> 0:06:53,37
The princess's noble butt
is being shown to the world!

80
0:06:53,37 --> 0:06:55,91
hide her butt!

81
0:06:55,91 --> 0:06:57,95
Defeat animals?

82
0:06:57,95 --> 0:07:00,00
So the blood of an animal lover
that flows through my veins

83
0:07:00,00 --> 0:07:03,75
forced me to give that impudent
girl a German suplex?

84
0:07:03,75 --> 0:07:05,25
You bastard...

85
0:07:09,83 --> 0:07:12,83
but you can't do that to the princess.

86
0:07:12,83 --> 0:07:17,16
I don't know what you're talking about
with this summoning and hero nonsense!

87
0:07:17,79 --> 0:07:21,33
But... perhaps I went too far.

88
0:07:21,33 --> 0:07:22,83
I know!

89
0:07:26,33 --> 0:07:27,75
Drape.

90
0:07:34,50 --> 0:07:36,79
Stop messing around!

91
0:07:36,79 --> 0:07:39,41
Capture him!

92
0:07:39,41 --> 0:07:40,25
Damn!

93
0:07:42,12 --> 0:07:43,20
why are they mad?

94
0:07:43,20 --> 0:07:46,70
What kind of lunatic waves
a sword at someone like that?

95
0:07:55,25 --> 0:07:57,12
This definitely isn't the arena.

96
0:07:57,12 --> 0:07:59,29
It's not even night anymore.

97
0:07:59,29 --> 0:08:02,08
Where am I?

98
0:08:02,08 --> 0:08:03,08
Who is that?

99
0:08:03,08 --> 0:08:04,16
Where are his pants?

100
0:08:04,16 --> 0:08:05,66
Is he a pervert?

101
0:08:05,66 --> 0:08:07,91
We should stay away...

102
0:08:07,91 --> 0:08:08,79
He looked over here.

103
0:08:08,79 --> 0:08:10,20
Don't meet his gaze.

104
0:08:10,20 --> 0:08:13,33
Somebody go call a hunter!

105
0:08:13,33 --> 0:08:16,75
I guess I'll just find someone
kind-looking to ask.

106
0:08:16,75 --> 0:08:19,79
excuse me... Can you tell me where I am?

107
0:08:22,75 --> 0:08:24,12
I get it!

108
0:08:24,12 --> 0:08:28,66
It's rude to ask people questions
while wearing a mask!

109
0:08:34,91 --> 0:08:38,62

I'm no longer Animal Mask--

110
0:08:38,62 --> 0:08:41,37
I'm an ordinary man named Genzo Shibata.

111
0:08:41,37 --> 0:08:42,25
Now no one will know...

112
0:08:42,25 --> 0:08:44,20
Over there! That's him!

113
0:08:44,20 --> 0:08:44,58
--Watch out! It's a pervert!

114
0:08:44,58 --> 0:08:47,08
--What?
--Watch out! It's a pervert!

115
0:08:47,08 --> 0:08:48,50
Impossible!

116
0:08:49,16 --> 0:08:50,50
The pervert ran away!

117
0:08:50,50 --> 0:08:51,75
After the pervert!

118
0:08:51,75 --> 0:08:54,45
I'm not a pervert! I'm a pro wrestler!

119
0:08:58,62 --> 0:09:02,04
I have no idea how they figured me out.

120
0:09:02,04 --> 0:09:04,58
Hiroyuki.

121
0:09:04,58 --> 0:09:07,75
I'll figure out a way out of this.

122
0:09:10,41 --> 0:09:12,12
Hiroyuki.

123
0:09:12,12 --> 0:09:14,70
Forgive me for being useless...

124
0:09:16,66 --> 0:09:20,45
Hiroyuki! I'm so glad you're here with me!

125
0:09:20,45 --> 0:09:23,29
I don't know what I would've done
if I were here by myself.

126
0:09:23,29 --> 0:09:25,08
I don't care about clothes! Not at all!

127
0:09:25,08 --> 0:09:28,00
My goal is to find food for you tonight!

128
0:09:29,08 --> 0:09:32,50
that pervert looks pretty buff.

129
0:09:32,50 --> 0:09:34,66
We could sell him for a lot.

130
0:09:34,66 --> 0:09:41,54
Yes. And that strange creature
would probably be worth a lot of cash.

131
0:09:49,95 --> 0:09:52,00
You're so cute...

132
0:09:52,00 --> 0:09:55,04
in your underwear.

133
0:09:55,04 --> 0:09:56,95
Wh-What?

134
0:09:56,95 --> 0:10:00,00
Animal ears?!

135
0:10:05,95 --> 0:10:07,33
A-And...

136
0:10:07,33 --> 0:10:09,37
right?

137
0:10:09,37 --> 0:10:11,45
Come with us and we'll give you some food.

138
0:10:11,45 --> 0:10:13,45
An animal!

139
0:10:13,45 --> 0:10:17,58
Do you like my hairy chest and tail?

140
0:10:19,91 --> 0:10:21,70
right?

141
0:10:21,70 --> 0:10:24,41
Do what he says...

142
0:10:30,58 --> 0:10:33,58
this guy seems like bad news...

143
0:10:33,58 --> 0:10:35,25
Y-Yeah...

144
0:10:35,25 --> 0:10:38,20
So fluffy!

145
0:10:38,20 --> 0:10:41,33
not me!

146
0:10:43,33 --> 0:10:45,37
W-We'll be on our way...

147
0:10:46,66 --> 0:10:48,45
What the hell?

148
0:10:48,45 --> 0:10:49,62
Do you want to fight?

149
0:10:49,62 --> 0:10:52,58
You think you can beat a beastman
with your bare hands?

150
0:10:52,58 --> 0:10:54,58
bro!

151
0:10:54,58 --> 0:10:58,00
huh?

152
0:10:59,70 --> 0:11:01,29
Bro!

153
0:11:08,45 --> 0:11:12,12
you jerk! Get off my brother!

154
0:11:12,12 --> 0:11:14,41
Stop sniffing him!

155
0:11:15,45 --> 0:11:17,37
this guy is crazy!

156
0:11:17,37 --> 0:11:18,79
He's crazy!

157
0:11:18,79 --> 0:11:23,37
so stop! Let him go!

158
0:11:23,37 --> 0:11:26,50
my bro will... my bro will...

159
0:11:26,50 --> 0:11:28,12
What's this guy's deal?

160
0:11:28,12 --> 0:11:30,54
He's incredibly strong!

161
0:11:30,54 --> 0:11:34,54
Don't worry!
You'll start to like it any second!

162
0:11:34,54 --> 0:11:37,16
huh?

163
0:11:37,16 --> 0:11:39,66
Stop it!

164
0:11:39,66 --> 0:11:43,41
We'll pay you! Stop it! Please!

165
0:11:43,41 --> 0:11:47,12
right? Good boy...

166
0:11:50,16 --> 0:11:52,37
you're next...

167
0:11:54,08 --> 0:11:56,79
Cat ears!

168
0:11:59,62 --> 0:12:02,79
give up already!

169
0:12:04,70 --> 0:12:07,41
You're about to be sold!

170
0:12:07,41 --> 0:12:10,29
No!

171
0:12:10,29 --> 0:12:14,79
I don't want to live at some noble's house
and get walks and naps and free snacks!

172
0:12:14,79 --> 0:12:17,12
Who said you were being sold to a noble?

173
0:12:17,12 --> 0:12:20,12
If that was the deal I'd go myself.

174
0:12:23,70 --> 0:12:25,29
I may be willing to let them sell me.

175
0:12:25,29 --> 0:12:29,25
Nobody will buy a beast girl like that!

176
0:12:29,25 --> 0:12:30,54
Let's go!

177
0:12:30,54 --> 0:12:30,91
--No!

178
0:12:30,91 --> 0:12:32,75
--A poor girl in unfortunate circumstances...
--No!

179
0:12:32,75 --> 0:12:34,16
Stop whining and let's go!

180
0:12:34,16 --> 0:12:37,75
It's not right for an outsider
like me to get involved.

181
0:12:37,75 --> 0:12:42,37
And not because I'd rather pet the cat ears...

182
0:12:42,37 --> 0:12:44,79
That tail! Those ears! Is that a wolf?

183
0:12:44,79 --> 0:12:48,45
but never a wolf!

184
0:12:50,95 --> 0:12:54,29
but my priority now is the wolf ears girl!

185
0:12:54,29 --> 0:12:57,00
Please...

186
0:12:57,00 --> 0:12:59,95
All praise animal ears and animal tails!

187
0:12:59,95 --> 0:13:01,29
That's far enough!

188
0:13:01,29 --> 0:13:04,20
Mind your own business.

189
0:13:05,70 --> 0:13:07,70
but try anything and you'll regret it.

190
0:13:07,70 --> 0:13:09,04
who are you?

191
0:13:09,04 --> 0:13:11,00
he's dangerous!

192
0:13:11,00 --> 0:13:13,54
He's a super-high-level pervert!

193
0:13:13,54 --> 0:13:15,95
He just had his way with my bro...

194
0:13:15,95 --> 0:13:17,20
What?

195
0:13:17,20 --> 0:13:19,95
What are you doing?

196
0:13:19,95 --> 0:13:22,20
Allow me to first correct
your misunderstanding.

197
0:13:22,20 --> 0:13:23,95
I am not a pervert.

198
0:13:23,95 --> 0:13:27,16
I simply love all animals
regardless of gender!

199
0:13:27,16 --> 0:13:30,25
See? He's more dangerous than he looks!

200
0:13:30,25 --> 0:13:33,12

the things he says...

201
0:13:33,12 --> 0:13:35,91
He's a pervert like none
the world has ever seen!

202
0:13:35,91 --> 0:13:37,79
Why do you fear?

203
0:13:37,79 --> 0:13:43,00

or what reasons you may have...

204
0:13:43,00 --> 0:13:44,70
No! Stop it!

205
0:13:44,70 --> 0:13:49,00
you are evil!

206
0:13:53,79 --> 0:13:56,79
Damn it!

207
0:13:56,79 --> 0:13:59,75
You pervert! We'll get you yet!

208
0:14:00,95 --> 0:14:04,91
had I?

209
0:14:04,91 --> 0:14:07,45
Why did you have to open your mouth?!

210
0:14:07,45 --> 0:14:10,00
You're right! I'm sorry!

211
0:14:10,00 --> 0:14:11,33
Um...

212
0:14:14,54 --> 0:14:17,58
Thank you for saving me!

213
0:14:17,58 --> 0:14:20,08
Now I won't be sold.

214
0:14:20,08 --> 0:14:22,54
Don't worry. I did it because I wanted to.

215
0:14:22,54 --> 0:14:25,25
right?

216
0:14:25,25 --> 0:14:30,16
so...

217
0:14:31,70 --> 0:14:32,66
I see.

218
0:14:32,66 --> 0:14:36,04
You were charged absurd amounts of interest
and then sold to pay your debts.

219
0:14:36,04 --> 0:14:39,37
I'm the one who said
that if I couldn't pay by the deadline

220
0:14:39,37 --> 0:14:41,33
he could sell me instead.

221
0:14:46,33 --> 0:14:51,00
and then cried and sobbed
in front of his shop until he gave in.

222
0:14:53,83 --> 0:14:56,45
but it didn't work out.

223
0:14:56,45 --> 0:14:59,12
She's a loser.

224
0:15:00,00 --> 0:15:01,58
What's that look?

225
0:15:01,58 --> 0:15:03,70
I was making money for a while!

226
0:15:03,70 --> 0:15:08,20
But then humans started copying me.

227
0:15:10,41 --> 0:15:12,25
I am Genzo Shibata.

228
0:15:12,25 --> 0:15:13,70
A pro wrestler.

229
0:15:13,70 --> 0:15:16,08
My name is Shigure.

230
0:15:16,08 --> 0:15:21,45
And this is Hiroyuki. My partner
and a mongrel of pure breeding.

231
0:15:22,75 --> 0:15:25,79
too!

232
0:15:25,79 --> 0:15:30,29
but...

233
0:15:30,29 --> 0:15:32,29
I'm broke.

234
0:15:32,29 --> 0:15:36,16
it sounds
less like I've done a good deed

235
0:15:36,16 --> 0:15:38,75
and more like I've committed a felony...

236
0:15:38,75 --> 0:15:40,16
Don't worry!

237
0:15:40,16 --> 0:15:43,58
Remember what I said about
people stealing my business model?

238
0:15:43,58 --> 0:15:47,00

the guy you just saw!

239
0:15:47,00 --> 0:15:50,70
right? Right? Right?

240
0:15:50,70 --> 0:15:56,75
just barely.

241
0:15:56,75 --> 0:15:58,50
So...

242
0:15:58,50 --> 0:16:00,91
right?

243
0:16:04,04 --> 0:16:06,29
You can pay with your body instead.

244
0:16:06,29 --> 0:16:08,45
He's a loser.

245
0:16:19,04 --> 0:16:20,91
I'll get him...

246
0:16:22,33 --> 0:16:24,45
huh?

247
0:16:25,58 --> 0:16:26,79
You okay?

248
0:16:26,79 --> 0:16:29,25
Damn that bastard.

249
0:16:29,25 --> 0:16:31,41
I won't just give up...

250
0:16:31,41 --> 0:16:33,87
I don't think there's anything you can do.

251
0:16:33,87 --> 0:16:36,04
Got a plan?

252
0:16:36,04 --> 0:16:40,33
Yeah. That strange creature he had.

253
0:16:40,33 --> 0:16:42,08
that?

254
0:16:42,08 --> 0:16:43,04
What will you do with it?

255
0:16:43,04 --> 0:16:45,66
What else? I'll steal it!

256
0:16:45,66 --> 0:16:48,08
Great idea! Let's do it!

257
0:16:48,08 --> 0:16:50,12
We're gonna do it!

258
0:16:50,12 --> 0:16:50,95
Yeah!

259
0:16:50,95 --> 0:16:52,83
--We'll show that pervert who's boss!

260
0:16:52,83 --> 0:16:55,29
--I have nothing but a bad feeling...
--We'll show that pervert who's boss!

261
0:16:57,50 --> 0:16:58,54
So this is it?

262
0:16:58,54 --> 0:17:00,50
Yes. The Hunter Guild.

263
0:17:00,50 --> 0:17:03,95
Let's work here for a while
to make some money.

264
0:17:06,29 --> 0:17:11,16
so there's probably lots of great jobs for you.

265
0:17:12,12 --> 0:17:16,00
I have complete confidence
in my ability to love any animal

266
0:17:16,00 --> 0:17:20,16

or even more specifically

267
0:17:20,16 --> 0:17:25,29
or tail length!

268
0:17:28,12 --> 0:17:31,20
So I'd like to maintain a relationship of love

269
0:17:31,20 --> 0:17:35,08
and caring with animals at all times!

270
0:17:37,08 --> 0:17:40,70
What? What is he talking about?

271
0:17:40,70 --> 0:17:42,25
And...

272
0:17:42,25 --> 0:17:49,08
most violent animal will
respond to my overwhelming love for them.

273
0:17:49,08 --> 0:17:50,04
So...

274
0:17:50,04 --> 0:17:51,12
What do I?

275
0:17:51,12 --> 0:17:53,87
What am I supposed to do here?

276
0:17:55,37 --> 0:17:56,91
Guild Master!

277
0:17:56,91 --> 0:17:58,25
What's going on?

278
0:17:58,25 --> 0:17:59,83
I'm saved!

279
0:17:59,83 --> 0:18:02,70
Our party was wiped out by a cerberus pack.

280
0:18:02,70 --> 0:18:04,91
What? Perfect.

281
0:18:04,91 --> 0:18:06,50
Will you go too?

282
0:18:06,50 --> 0:18:08,50
Cerberuses are terrifying monsters...

283
0:18:08,50 --> 0:18:09,33
What?

284
0:18:09,33 --> 0:18:10,16
Where are they?

285
0:18:10,16 --> 0:18:13,08
Genzo! Wait!

286
0:18:13,08 --> 0:18:14,37
What?

287
0:18:14,37 --> 0:18:19,12
What sort of man isn't scared of a cerberus
and instead runs out to meet them?

288
0:18:19,12 --> 0:18:22,00
What a brave man.

289
0:18:22,00 --> 0:18:26,33
But... I didn't understand
a word he was saying.

290
0:18:27,75 --> 0:18:29,08
It's deep in this forest!

291
0:18:29,08 --> 0:18:30,16
Okay!

292
0:18:30,16 --> 0:18:31,58
I don't think I've seen you before.

293
0:18:31,58 --> 0:18:33,00
Are you going unarmed?

294
0:18:33,00 --> 0:18:34,62
You can borrow this if you want.

295
0:18:34,62 --> 0:18:36,04
Fool!

296
0:18:36,04 --> 0:18:39,70
Do I look like a wrestler
who uses weapons to you?

297
0:18:40,95 --> 0:18:42,62
He's going to fight them unarmed?

298
0:18:42,62 --> 0:18:45,16
How confident is he?

299
0:18:45,16 --> 0:18:48,08
I'll borrow it...

300
0:18:48,08 --> 0:18:51,87
we can't let them get near the town!

301
0:18:51,87 --> 0:18:53,70
Stop them here!

302
0:18:58,95 --> 0:19:00,58
This is bad!

303
0:19:00,58 --> 0:19:02,16
So these are cerberuses?

304
0:19:02,16 --> 0:19:04,79
They've got three heads!

305
0:19:07,33 --> 0:19:10,37
That means triple the fun!

306
0:19:10,37 --> 0:19:12,41
So there are animals like this in this world?

307
0:19:12,41 --> 0:19:14,87
but...

308
0:19:16,16 --> 0:19:17,54
Are you scared?

309
0:19:17,54 --> 0:19:19,45
calm down.

310
0:19:19,45 --> 0:19:20,79
Hey!

311
0:19:20,79 --> 0:19:24,66
let's see how he handles this.

312
0:19:24,66 --> 0:19:26,70
Yes...

313
0:19:27,37 --> 0:19:30,62
Cerberus!

314
0:19:32,37 --> 0:19:33,95
They appear to be a type of dog.

315
0:19:36,87 --> 0:19:39,91
the others will quickly open up to me as well.

316
0:19:39,91 --> 0:19:44,16
The leader is probably...
the one guarding the rear!

317
0:19:44,16 --> 0:19:45,37
You?

318
0:19:45,37 --> 0:19:47,45
Hello!

319
0:19:47,45 --> 0:19:48,37
He ran in!

320
0:19:48,37 --> 0:19:50,87
Gotcha!

321
0:19:50,87 --> 0:19:52,50
He dodged them!

322
0:19:54,79 --> 0:19:58,08
Good boy! Let's play!

323
0:20:01,08 --> 0:20:02,95
And now for the leader!

324
0:20:05,83 --> 0:20:07,79
Come here!

325
0:20:14,45 --> 0:20:15,95
He pinned it!

326
0:20:15,95 --> 0:20:17,41
What kind of move is that?

327
0:20:19,04 --> 0:20:20,41
But there are others...

328
0:20:20,41 --> 0:20:21,33
This is bad!

329
0:20:21,33 --> 0:20:22,58
Should we help?

330
0:20:22,58 --> 0:20:24,83
Stay out of this!

331
0:20:25,58 --> 0:20:28,16
He's keeping us out of danger?

332
0:20:28,16 --> 0:20:30,25
What a man!

333
0:20:31,12 --> 0:20:34,50
I think I'm starting to figure him out...

334
0:20:34,50 --> 0:20:37,54
Good boy! Good boy!

335
0:20:37,54 --> 0:20:40,58
huh?

336
0:20:47,58 --> 0:20:50,66
Good boy... You're such a good boy...

337
0:20:50,66 --> 0:20:54,16
He really pinned it with his bare hands...

338
0:20:54,16 --> 0:20:56,16
Like you'd pin down a lady...

339
0:20:56,16 --> 0:20:57,83
He's like a lady killer...

340
0:20:57,83 --> 0:21:00,12
he's...

341
0:21:00,12 --> 0:21:02,00
...a demon beast killer!

342
0:21:11,66 --> 0:21:13,95
as well as pay for an inn for a while.

343
0:21:13,95 --> 0:21:15,41
Yeah.

344
0:21:15,41 --> 0:21:18,25
what will you do now?

345
0:21:18,25 --> 0:21:20,75
I've made my decision.

346
0:21:20,75 --> 0:21:24,04
I want people to understand
how wonderful demon beasts are!

347
0:21:24,04 --> 0:21:26,79
Indeed! I'll bring about a world
where demon beasts and humans

348
0:21:26,79 --> 0:21:28,25
can understand each other!

349
0:21:28,25 --> 0:21:30,91
That's impossible in this country.

350
0:21:30,91 --> 0:21:31,83
No...

351
0:21:33,45 --> 0:21:35,95
I believe I can do it.

352
0:21:35,95 --> 0:21:38,12
So you must believe too.

353
0:21:40,25 --> 0:21:44,87
is the reason
you refused to be a hero...?

354
0:21:44,87 --> 0:21:49,87
That princess demanded I defeat animals!

355
0:21:49,87 --> 0:21:53,33

beast people and humans...

356
0:21:53,33 --> 0:21:56,62
too!

357
0:21:56,62 --> 0:21:59,25
Really? Then let's do this!

358
0:21:59,25 --> 0:22:05,12

the four of us including Hiroyuki!

359
0:22:06,08 --> 0:22:07,75
Yes!

360
0:22:07,75 --> 0:22:08,91
Four?

361
0:22:13,16 --> 0:22:14,37
Who are you?

362
0:23:45,91 --> 0:23:49,91
Next time: "Quest x Demon Beast Killer."
